### bank-management

This project consists of:
- SQL and PL/SQL scripts to setup and test an Oracle database for bank data;
- command-line application to interact with said database.

It was written as part of BD1 (Bazy Danych 1, Databases 1) class in semester 22Z (winter 2022).

The project is written in Oracle SQL and Java, using JDBC library for communication with the database.

The program can be compiled and run with the command from the `run_command.txt` file.

The Oracle database server was only available during the class, now that the class is finished, the server is no
longer available and the application will not work, unless another database is specified in `connection.properties`.

More detailed documentation is available in Polish in the file `documentation/BD1_opis_projektu.pdf`.
